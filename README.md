# WebParse

## Rewrite Beta 1.2

Rewrite Dev v1.0

- Added some error handling to some of the try except blocks

- Optimised the name match API calls

- Added Debug to commented out lines of code


Rewrite Dev v1.1

- Fixed issue with results not showing it was due to a error in calculating the longest list inside the output function I forgot to get max(len()) not just max() of all the lists


Rewrite Dev v1.2

- Added a lot more names and words

- Cut the time of parsing names from 20s down to 2s and decreased the number of API call by 90%. There is an issue of it missing names that are in the CommonWords.txt this needs to be fixed by removing common names from that file.
