# WebParse
Version Number: Beta 1.0.0

About:

This is a parsing script to pull phone numbers, emails, names, and addresses from the output of a web request.

I plan to integrate this into an OSINT automation tool that I am working on. This is one of many modules for that project.

Request, re, BeautifulSoup

APIs used:

   dictionary API: dictionaryapi.dev
