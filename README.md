# WebParse
Version Number: Beta 0.1.1

About:

This is a text parsing script to pull phone numbers, emails, names, and addresses from the output of a web request.

I plan to integrate this into an OSINT automation tool that I am coding up. This is one of many modules for that project.

Goals:

The goal of this project is to filter phone numbers, emails, names, and addresses from the output HTML of a web request.

Methods:

I am mainly using regex to parse, but I anticipate using an API for the names and addresses.

Libraries used:

Request, re, Pandas, BeautifulSoup
